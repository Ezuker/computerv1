<p id="description">A command-line tool that solves linear and quadratic equations with advanced features. The program takes an algebraic equation as input calculates its reduced form determines the equation's degree and provides comprehensive solutions. Additional capabilities include displaying solutions as irreducible fractions showing detailed solving steps handling entry errors gracefully supporting free-form input and generating a graphical plot of the equation with its solutions.</p>
